# hello-world
This file is the beginning of my technology exploration
I have been looking at and reading about a few programming languages for
the past month or so. I spent the most time on python and completed about half of an intro course
on it and have also been considering javascript and node.js.
I seem to be leaning toward node.js for some reason.
